        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>We’ve redesigned our three most popular back saws to feature a slight tapering 
          of the blade from toe to heel. This taper gives you better control over precise 
          cuts. When you reach the gauge line on the front of your stock, the blade is 
          slightly above the line on the back side, which reduces the risk of sawing past 
          your line. In addition, the taper introduces an angled approach to your stock 
          (when holding the saw back parallel to the bench), enabling faster cuts with 
          less effort.
          The cutting depth is 1-3/8" at the toe and 1-5/8" at the heel.
          The saw plate is .015" thick.
          Teeth are filed rip, 15 ppi, set at .003" per side.
          Overall length, including handle, is 15", with a blade length of 10".
          Overall height is 4-1/4".

        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <p>We believe that our Back Saws are the finest made anywhere. Solid milled Brass back, 
          best quality Swedish Steel blade, Maple handle and traditional Brass saw nuts and bolts. 
          Practice on some scrap wood to acquaint yourself with how your saw cuts. If you had a 
          poor sawing technique before, your new saw will force you to learn the proper sawing 
          technique. Don’t worry — once learned, it’ll be smooth cutting. If your saw seems to 
          “grab” the wood and jump around in the kerf, you’re using too much downward pressure. 
          Ease up a bit and take long slow strokes.

          <h2>Tool Care</h2>
          <h3>Maintenence</h3>
          <p>It is a good idea to keep a coat of oil or silicon spray on your saw's blade 
            when not in use. This will minimize the chance of rust forming on the blade. 
            The blade is high carbon steel with no rust-inhibiting alloys added. The handle 
            on your saw is oiled and buffed with wax to produce a natural finish. Wipe with 
            oil as desired to refresh.
          </p>
          <h3>Sharpening</h3>
          <p>The steel in your saw's blade is the best that's available. It is very hard (50-52R) 
            and will stay sharp a long time. Eventually, however, you'll have to sharpen it. You
            can do this easily yourself with a little practice. We use a 6" double extra slim taper 
            file to file the teeth on our Tenon Saws. We use a 5" double extra slim taper file to 
            file the teeth on our Carcass and Dovetail Saws, and you can do the same if you're skilled 
            at filing. If not, start with a smaller 4" extra slim taper file, which will make it 
            easier to line up the file with the gullet for beginning filers.
