          <div class="detailsp">
            <p>We’ve redesigned our three most popular back saws to feature a slight tapering 
              of the blade from toe to heel. This taper gives you better control over precise 
              cuts.
            </p>
            <p>When you reach the gauge line on the front of your stock, the blade is 
              slightly above the line on the back side, which reduces the risk of sawing past 
              your line. In addition, the taper introduces an angled approach to your stock 
              (when holding the saw back parallel to the bench), enabling faster cuts with 
              less effort.
            </p>
            <p>The cutting depth is 1-3/8" at the toe and 1-5/8" at the heel.
              The saw plate is .015" thick.
              Teeth are filed rip, 15 ppi, set at .003" per side.
              Overall length, including handle, is 15", with a blade length of 10".
              Overall height is 4-1/4".

        <div class="howtouse">
          <h2>How to Use</h2>
          <p>Your saw is very sharp when it arrives. When starting a cut, hold the 
            saw blade so it is flush with the top of the stock. It is not necessary 
            to tilt your saw at an angle when cutting. Best performance is obtained 
            by sawing slowly and evenly with very little downward pressure, using as 
            much of the blade as possible. Your saw will track right to the line. Be 
            aware, however, that due to the slight set, your saw will be hard to 
            correct if it starts to cut away from the line. If that happens, it’s 
            because you didn’t line it up properly when you started.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will find that your saw is a joy to use. Unlike most saws on the 
            market, every Lie-Nielsen saw has been precision set, filed, and test 
            cut in hardwood before it leaves the shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing you’ll need to know about your saw is how to hold it. 
            This may seem obvious, but many people try to wrap all four fingers 
            around the handle. The proper grip is to wrap the middle, ring, and 
            little fingers around the handle with the forefinger pointing along 
            the Brass back. You’ll discover that in doing so, you will have much 
            better control over how your saw tracks, and it will also feel very 
            comfortable and natural.
          </p>
          <p>
            Practice on some scrap wood to acquaint yourself with how your saw 
            cuts. If you had a poor sawing technique before, your new saw will 
            force you to learn the proper sawing technique. Don’t worry — once 
            learned, it’ll be smooth cutting. If your saw seems to “grab” the 
            wood and jump around in the kerf, you’re using too much downward 
            pressure. Ease up a bit and take long slow strokes.

          <div class="maintenence">
            <h3>Maintenence</h3>
            <p>It is a good idea to keep a coat of oil or silicon spray on your saw's blade 
              when not in use. This will minimize the chance of rust forming on the blade. 
              The blade is high carbon steel with no rust-inhibiting alloys added. The handle 
              on your saw is oiled and buffed with wax to produce a natural finish. Wipe with 
              oil as desired to refresh.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="sharpening">
            <h3>Sharpening</h3>
            <p>The steel in your saw's blade is the best that's available. It is very hard (50-52R) 
              and will stay sharp a long time. Eventually, however, you'll have to sharpen it. You
              can do this easily yourself with a little practice. We use a 6" double extra slim taper 
              file to file the teeth on our Tenon Saws. We use a 5" double extra slim taper file to 
              file the teeth on our Carcass and Dovetail Saws, and you can do the same if you're skilled 
              at filing. If not, start with a smaller 4" extra slim taper file, which will make it 
              easier to line up the file with the gullet for beginning filers.
